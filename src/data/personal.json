        "As a final-year Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering undergraduate at the University of Ruhuna, my journey is rooted in a strong academic foundation and a passion for practical application. I've actively sought hands-on experience through two industrial training placements with Ansell Lanka and Electro Metal Pressings, where I worked on automation, maintenance, and design projects. This practical experience is complemented by my role as a co-founder of NexaTech Engineering Solutions, providing 3D modeling and simulation services.",
        "I specialize in automation, product design, and sustainable technologies, with a portfolio of academic projects that includes a portable solar cooker and an automated waste compactor. Beyond technical work, I am deeply involved in university life, holding leadership positions like Secretary of the IESL Ruhuna Engineering Student Chapter and organizing workshops and competitions. My engagement in creative arts like music and dance has further honed my teamwork and communication skills, preparing me to contribute effectively to innovative engineering solutions."
